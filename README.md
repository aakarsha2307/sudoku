# Sudoku Solver in Python

## What is Sudoku?
Sudoku is a popular logic puzzle played on a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 boxes.  
The goal is to fill the grid so that each row, each column, and each 3x3 box contains all digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.  
Starting with some cells pre-filled as clues, players use logic and deduction (without guessing) to complete the puzzle.

## Features
- Solves any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.
- Checks number placement validity according to Sudoku rules.
- Simple recursive backtracking algorithm.
- Prints the solved Sudoku grid or informs if no solution exists.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x installed.
- No additional libraries needed.

## How to Run
1. Save the Python code as sudoku_solver.py.
2. Edit or define the Sudoku puzzle in the code (empty cells as 0).
3. Execute the script in a terminal or command prompt:
4. View the solved board printed in the console.

## Internal Structure
- can_place(board, row, col, num):
- Checks if num can be placed at (row, col) without conflicts.
- solve(board):
- Uses recursive backtracking to fill empty cells with valid numbers.
- print_board(board):
- Prints each row of the Sudoku board.

The solve function finds empty cells, tries valid numbers, and recurses; if stuck, it backtracks to try alternatives.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Backtracking algorithm for constraint satisfaction.
- Recursion as a problem-solving method.
- Logical validation in grid puzzles.
- Handling 2D lists (arrays) in Python.

## Possible Extensions
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for easy puzzle input/output.
- Add heuristics or optimization strategies to speed up solving.
- Support Sudoku puzzles of other sizes (4x4, 16x16).
- Create Sudoku puzzles generator with difficulty levels.
- Provide step-by-step solving hints or explanations.
