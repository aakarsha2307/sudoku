# Sudoku Solver Project Statement

## Project Statement
The Sudoku Solver project is a Python-based application designed to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles automatically 
using a backtracking algorithm. The program accepts an incomplete Sudoku grid as input and fills empty cells
with numbers following Sudoku rules to arrive at a valid, complete solution.

## Scope
- Solve standard 9x9 Sudoku puzzles with guaranteed unique solutions.
- Validate number placement according to Sudoku constraints (rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids).
- Handle puzzles of varying difficulty.
- Provide a console-based interface for inputting puzzles and displaying solutions.
- Exclude puzzle generation and graphical user interface in the initial scope.

## Target Users
- Beginners and intermediate programmers learning algorithms and backtracking.
- Sudoku enthusiasts wanting an automatic solver tool.
- Educators and students using it as a learning resource for recursion and constraint satisfaction problems.

## Inclusion
- A Python script implementing the backtracking Sudoku solver algorithm.
- Functions for validating moves, solving the puzzle, and printing results.
- A sample Sudoku puzzle for demonstration.
- Documentation explaining usage and code structure.

## High-Level Features
- Recursive backtracking algorithm to fill empty cells.
- Safety checks to ensure valid number placements.
- User-friendly output printing the solved Sudoku grid.
- Detection and messaging when no valid solution exists.
